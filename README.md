# Punch-Out--Wii-.dsp-to-.wem-for-.bnk-Files-Converter
Converts 2 channel dsp files to two channel .wem files to be put in .bnks with BNKEditor. Deleted old repository for privacy reasons. 

Will work on updating GUI and 1 channel files if possible.

# Current Status
This will allow you to convert 2-channel dsp files into a 2-channel wem file. It won't stop you from using a single-channel file either, but it doesn't play nice when you actually try to play it, and I'm not putting in the effort to tell my users that 1-channel files are no-go for now. If the channels are not the same, then it will stop you from continuing and force you to exit.

I use Pycharm and Python 3 to run my program. If you've got any tips or suggestions on how to improve my code, I would be happy to hear them! (Hopefully one day I will know code well enough that I don't have to worry about how it all works so then I can use 75% less comments...)

Have fun!
